            <p>The DIVOC issued Verifiable Certificate has a digitally signed secure QR code. This can be authenticated online using the verification utility in this portal.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Complete QR code should be part of camera frame</li>
                <li>QR code should be parallel to the camera</li>
                <li>Camera should be held steadily for at least 5 seconds</li>
                <li>If camera is unable to read the QR code within 45 seconds, a message - “Camera is not able to read the QR code, please try again” with a try again button will be displayed. Verifier will be required to scan the QR code again following the instructions mentioned in Step 2.</li>
